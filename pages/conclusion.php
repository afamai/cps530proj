<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>
Our overall experience with Laravel was "okay." For what we wanted to create, the framework did perform to our expectations.<br><br>

We all agree, however, that it was not worth all the effort that went into trying to install and host a server for it.<br><br>

Pages were fairly easy to create as Laravel is a mix of HTML and PHP. A noteable difference is that Laravel uses curly brackets { } to show when PHP is being used whereas HTML uses angle brackets and question marks, <xmp> <? ?> </xmp> to show when PHP is being used.<br><br>

There is definitely a steep learning curve for Laravel compared to regular HTML and CSS. Laravel has many features that allow the user to create databases and implement secutrity (authentication, authorization, etc); however, these features were not neccessary for us to complete the assignemnt so we did not use them.<br><br>

Finally, is there anything we would have done differently for this assignment? No, not really. But did we regret choosing Laravel? Yeah, probably.
