<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<h3>Did the framework/CMS you choose perform to your expectations?</h3>
<p>For what we wanted to create, Laravel performed to our expectations.</p>

<h3>Was the framework/CMS you chose difficult to install or configure?</h3>
<p>Installing Laravel and trying to host a server for it was a pain in the butt.</p>

<h3>Was it easy the create the page with the chosen framework/CMS?</h3>
<p>Pages were fairly easy to create, as Laravel is a mix of HTML and PHP. A noteable difference is that Laravel uses curly brackets { } to show when PHP is being used whereas HTML uses angle brackets and question marks, <xmp> <? ?> </xmp> to show when PHP is being used.</p>

<h3>Was the learning curve steep compared with regular HTML/CSS?</h3>
<p>There is definitely a steep learning curve for Laravel compared to regular HTML and CSS. Laravel has many features that allow the user to create databases and implement secutrity (authentication, authorization, etc); however, these features were not neccessary for us to complete the assignemnt so we did not use them.</p>

<h3>Would you have done things differently in retrospect?</h3>
<p>Not really...</p>

<h3>Did you regret your choice of framework/CMS?</h3>
<p>Haha...Yeah.</p>
